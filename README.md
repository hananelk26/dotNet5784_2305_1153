# Task management project

## Description:

The project deals with task management, maintains a list of engineers and a list of tasks and provides 
- An option to set an automatic schedule for tasks considering tasks that depend on other tasks and should be completed earlier,
- Assigning engineers to tasks. 
- An engineer can report progress on a task. 
- In addition, the project supports a Gantt chart that shows the status of tasks and the dependencies between the tasks.


## The list of bonuses made in the project:

- Using the generic ToStringProperty to implement ToString (point 1)
- Saving and restoring system clock (1 point)
- Algorithm for building an automatic lozenge as described in the general description document, as in the basic requirement: Option 1 - only on the basis of the existing data (2 points)
- Validation (basic integrity check) is integrated into a data link [binding] (students) Confirmation - (1 point)
- Icon (icon) in the title of the window and the task bar (students) Confirmed - (1 point)
- Use of triggers (coordinators - 1 point each type of trigger).
- (1) Property Trigger: in the APP file when you move the mouse over the buttons, the text changes.
- (2) Event Trigger: In the main window, there is an animation that uses a trigger because the animation is triggered when the event of loading the image into the control tree occurs. 
- (3) Data Trigger: In the "ManagerView" window resources, a trigger is used to change the color of the label at the bottom of the screen.
- Use of ControlTemplate (centers - 1 point) The APP file is used regarding the style of the button control whose edges will be rounded.
- Significant use of transformations (centers - 1 point) In the animation that is in the main window, transformation is used so that the image floats on the screen.
- Graphics (shape) (centers - 1 point) The Gantt chart is used, the tasks are represented by rectangles.
